Welcome to my portfolio! I am a doctoral researcher at the University of Eastern Finland, here showcasing my most significant achievements in machine vision methods and the topic of my dissertation.

Written three high-quality publications,serving as the lead author for each (PhDPublications.md) centered around the subject of my dissertation.[Click here to view the subject of my dissertation](assets/dissertation2.jpg) In publications, I presented novel methods I developed to solve a previously unsolved problem, leading to significant advances in the field. These methods are the result of extensive and dedicated work and have been duly recognized by the research community.  

In the DigiCenterNS project, I developed a pioneering machine vision method [Click here to view the method in action](assets/BoreHoleDetection2021KoponenJarmo2021.jpg) to accurately identify the size and location of holes drilled in rock walls. This powerful and precise approach,developed specifically for this application,demonstrates my ability to apply machine vision expertise to practical challenges.

Education: Master of Science in Software Engineering, with a specialization in Machine Vision, Deep Learning, and Pattern Recognition.   [Click here to view the machine vision method developed in my Master's Thesis](assets/MachineVisionProGradu.jpg) 
I graduated with a diploma, achieving commendable grades. I also hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Software Engineering, complemented by a minor in Electrical and Automation Engineering. My experience as an automation engineer and electrician has endowed me with a robust technical foundation, which has been instrumental in advancing my research.

Research Interests: Deeply passionate about research in machine vision, pattern recognition, and deep learning, driven to tackle new challenges in these areas. I welcome connections and opportunities that can not only augment my skill set but also contribute significantly to the advancement of the field.

Research Expertise: Merging Theory and Practice in Machine Vision. My proficiency lies in effectively interpreting academic literature and applying the latest computer vision techniques in practical scenarios. With extensive experience in industrial machine vision systems and a profound understanding of the key characteristics of the study objects, I am well-equipped to address and solve complex research challenges in this field.
