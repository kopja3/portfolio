Welcome to my portfolio!
I am Jarmo Koponen, and I am currently working as a doctoral reseacher at University of Eastern Finland. 
I am proud to share with you a few of my most significant achievements related to the topic of my dissertation and machine vision methods.

I take pride in being the lead author of three peer-reviewed publications (PhDPublications.md) centered around the subject of my dissertation. In these publications, I introduced a novel method to address previously unsolved problems, resulting in significant advancements in the field. These accomplishments are the outcomes of extensive and dedicated work, duly recognized by the research community.

Furthermore, through my involvement in the ERDF-supported Regional Council of Pohjois-Savo DigiCenterNS project, I developed an innovative machine vision![method](BoreHoleDetection2021KoponenJarmo2021.jpg)for accurately identifying the sizes and positions of holes drilled in rock walls. This groundbreaking approach has enhanced efficiency and precision in the field of rock engineering, showcasing my capacity to apply my machine vision expertise to practical challenges.

In terms of education, I have completed a master's degree in software engineering, specializing in machine vision, deep learning, and pattern recognition. I received a diploma with commendable grades. Additionally, I have earned a Bachelor of Science degree in software engineering with a minor in electrical and automation engineering. My background as an automation engineer and electrician has provided me with a solid technical foundation that I have been able to apply in my research.

I am passionate about my research work and motivated to continue solving new challenges in machine vision, pattern recognition, and deep learning. I am open to connections and opportunities that can further enhance my skills and contribute value to the field's development.

Thank you for reviewing my portfolio, and I look forward to future opportunities and collaborations!
