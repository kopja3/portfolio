# Machine Vision R&D at Newlcon Oy

- In my role at Newlcon Oy, I undertook challenging research and development tasks in the field of computer vision. Specifically, I focused on using computer vision to identify medication packages within the LSO and Mega Fixu pharmacy dispensing machines, which often presented the complexity of partially or fully stacked medication packages.

Throughout this period, I demonstrated outstanding performance, highlighting my initiative and ability to handle complex tasks effectively. My commitment to enhancing my expertise in machine vision technology resulted in exceptional outcomes in achieving the objectives set for my Pro Gradu thesis. I am proud to mention that my university assessed my thesis as commendable, equivalent to a rating of 4/5. Furthermore, I maintained a commendable professional demeanor throughout my employment.
