### Into Passion and Professionalism: Blending Photography with Engineering

#### My passion for pictures and photography is not only my work; it's a key ingredient in my free time. I've been into photography since I was young, first with an analog film camera, and now with a quadcopter camera and various digital cameras. Experience is vital in this field, which demands precision in different areas. Growing up, I developed an interest in electrical engineering, and now I work as an automation engineer. This combination of interests and skills has given me a unique perspective and enabled me to effectively solve machine vision issues with customers globally.

#### One of my strengths lies in my career in the industry, equipping me with a better-than-normal ability to manage complex problems. In my spare time, I indulge in my other passions like running, swimming, skiing, boating, and summer camping. I'm also a big nature lover, enjoying time in the forest and fishing.
