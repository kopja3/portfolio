### My Free Time: Capturing Moments in Life

In my free time, I have a deep passion for various outdoor activities and hobbies, which complement my professional life as an automation engineer. Here's a glimpse of some of my favorite moments:

#### Photography: A Lifelong Passion
I've been passionate about photography since my youth. It all began with an analog film camera, and over the years, I've transitioned to using a quadcopter camera and various digital cameras. Photography is not just my work; it's an integral part of my life, allowing me to capture the beauty of the world around me. Here are a few snapshots:
